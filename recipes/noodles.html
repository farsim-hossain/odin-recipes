    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>350g fresh or dried egg noodles</li> 
        <li>1½ tbsp sesame oil</li>
        <li>1½ tbsp groundnut oil</li>
        
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>If you are using fresh noodles, blanch them first for 3-5 minutes in boiling water. If you are using dried noodles, cook them in boiling water according to packet instructions.</li>
        <li>Plunge them in cold water, drain thoroughly, toss them in the sesame oil and set aside until you are ready to use them. Covered with cling film, they can be kept for up to 2 hours in the refrigerator.</li>
        <li>Plunge the noodles into boiling water for 30 seconds or until they are just heated through, then drain well in a colander or sieve. Quickly tip the noodles into a large bowl and pour the hot sauce over the top. Mix everything together loosely then sprinkle on the spring onions and serve.</li>
